# Hey, I’m Jhems 👋

### Builder • Designer • Problem Solver

I build **scalable digital products** at the intersection of **engineering, design, and business**.
From clean mobile apps to production-ready systems, I care about *how things work* and *why they exist*.

Currently shipping software at **WebNX** and sharpening my business instincts through an **MBA at NMIMS**.

## 🧠 How I Think

> Technology builds solutions.
> Business direction gives those solutions purpose.

I don’t just write code —
I design systems, lead people, and take ownership from **idea → execution → impact**.

## 🚀 What I Do (In Plain English)

* Build **mobile & web applications** that scale
* Design **clean, user-centric interfaces**
* Lead **cross-functional teams** and ship on timelines
* Bridge the gap between **engineering, UX, and business goals**

No fluff. No over-engineering. Just results.
